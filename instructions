- Title - Diabetes detection using machine learning.
steps included -
1. Diabetes data
2. Pre Processing data
3. Train Test Split
4. Support Vector Machine Classifier
- Output - After feeding new data into the SVM it will be able to predict whether a person has Diabetes or does not have it.
- Dataset - PIMA data set information about blood-sugar, glucose level, insulin, age, etc. And the last column shows if the person has diabetes or not. And also the data set contains 768 entries.
